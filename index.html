		<h3>A Little History</h3>
		<p>Lacourse Design Co. is the freelance business of designer & web developer, Mike Lacourse. I’ve worked in all areas of the web, from coding complex social networks, to looking at how brand experiences take shape on the web, to designing beautiful, engaging web interfaces. Bringing together perspectives from development, design, and marketing inform and deepen my overall approach and give my clients uniquely powerful web solutions. I often works with business’s and entrepeneurs who are looking to design the technical side of their business or craft their marketing efforts online.</p>

		<h4>Community</h4>
		<p>Are you doing important work in your commmunity? I'm sometimes able to offer discounted design services for non-profits, co-operatives, and collectives. Get in touch to learn more.</p>

		<!--
		<h4>After Hours</h4>
		<p>After long hard days of designing and programming I spend my spare time crafting the perfect song and learning as much as I can. I also love traveling and exploring natural landscapes. Check out my latest adventures here.</p>

		<h3>Open Source Frameworks</h3>
		<p>Using WordPress and WordPress frameworks can cut development costs by 50% or more. Using frameworks allow me to spend my time getting the details right like refining the user experience, and working on custom features. These frameworks aren’t just good because they’re open-source, in many cases they’re some of the best in the industry. WordPress itself powers a staggering 23% of the internet and has grown into a mature and flexible system that can power even a complex web business.</p>

		<h4>This Is What Democracy Looks Like</h4>
		<p>No other platform embodies the spirit of democratic, open source software more than WordPress. The platform was built for and by it's users and in the process catalyzed one of the largest do-it-yourself development communities in the world. This means if you ever have a question about WordPress, it's probably been asked and answered a hundred times already.</p>
